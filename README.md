# iTunes Songs

It is a app that lists songs from iTunes for a query term (Using the iTunes API). See live [here](https://sameep-sehgal.github.io/iTunes-API/#/).

The project uses a proxy (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) to bypass CORS error that arised while accessing the iTunes API. This may have lead to sluggish performance.
